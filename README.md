# Cement-Comprensive-strength

The compressive strength of cement gives the idea about the basic cement strength. It gives the assurance for using. From this test, you can find how much cement is required and how much strength it will get. The compressive strength of cement is also the basic data needed for mix design.

Cement, basically is known by its compressive strength. Cement is identified by its grade like 53 grade, 43 grade, 33 grade of cement. This grade indicates the compressive strength of cement, i.e. 53 grade of cement indicates that compressive strength of cement cube after 28 days of curing will be 53 N/mm2 (MPa) or 530 kg/cm2.
